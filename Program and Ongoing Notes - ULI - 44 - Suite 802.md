*Italics = Verbiage by Landlord*

- Tenant is a software development company
- 6/7 people total
	- 1 private office
		- Owner/Tenant open to reevaluate the entire enclosure around office, using polycarbonate panels.  That is,  demoing the (3) existing drywall walls and door/trim/sidelight and creating a cost-effective ([unistrut](https://www.google.com/search?q=unistrut&rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS591US591&biw=1920&bih=955&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj-1eWwmfPMAhUm44MKHUEpBpIQ_AUICCgC)), unique "element" within the space.
			- Perhaps to save costs, we could demo the walls up to where the wall meets the ACT line (save the ACT in the office).  We could header this portion off, with kickers from the wall back to the slab, and the polycarbonate could start from there down to the floor.
			- They would like a few selective areas to be glass, however, as to have a small view to the exterior and perhaps one within door (glass inset), to see inside office.
			- The cost of this approach might be prohibitive, however.  With that in mind, let's have alternate fall back plan in mind--that is, reusing doors and sidelights, etc.
		- Could potentially be a barn door type of door into office, as well.
		- tenant to bring existing desk.  Will ask for existing dimensions.
	- Demo
		- demo all other existing offices that are near the storefront
		- *Remove existing reception desk, and repair affected walls.*
			- There was some discussion on potenially removing the drywall around the columns to expose the concrete.
				- This makes more sense now, with industrial look/feel of polycarbonate.
	- 6 workstations
		- Desks
			- back to back arrangment, as much as possible.  Just linear desks.
				- perpendicular to exterior storefront
			- 24" deep
			- some employees have dual moniters.
				- no need for dividers between desks.
			- one file cabinet
			- OD to Provide tenant a short list of desk options.
				- lighter color scheme.
					- alum/white/light wood
						- not black or dark colors.
				- Tenant will pick the chairs throughout.
		- Power
			- With workstations against storefront, provide a enclosed raceway along existing sill mullion.
			- Other desk locations, power can be at wall, use existing locations as much as possible.
		- small like ~3ft dia roundtable in/around workstation area.
- Waiting/relaxing areas are nice, although not crucial.
- 6 person conference table in open office
	- tenant would like it near entry, not next to 'open office'.
	- 3.5' diameter table.
		- OD to provide tenant with short list of table options.
	- Power receptacle at wall near conf. table
	- Perhaps have a small cabinet near conf. table, but not crucial, it sounds.
	- Tenant uses a portable projector... projecting from conf. table onto frosted glass marker board wall. (could it be polycarbonate?)
		- frosted glass marker board wall. (potential design feature)
			- Most likely floor to ceiling, or on standoffs from the wall.
				- Research on glass wall to accommodate the display of the projector.
- *Relocate sink from private office to the current reception area.*
	- there might be a alternate place for this, depending on how everything lays out.
		- most likely near conference table however.
	- Will have upper and lower cabinets as well around the sink area.
	- Like idea about screen in front to coffee area, as indicated on plan.  Polycarbonate as well?  Like opportunity for signage, there as well, maybe.
- Ceiling: Two options potentially
	- 1.Existing ACT grid to be used as feasible or...
		- *"Remove existing office walls, patch ceiling between and add a bulkhead to transition to the higher ceiling area to avoid replacement of entire ceiling."*
			-  ULI will do selective removal of ACT tiles within the next couple days so OD can do an extensive survey of existing conditions.
				- Open to the potential of exposing the concete ceiling, but dependent on existing conditions.  Will most likely not be entire ceiling, however, as too many hard surfaces will create an echoey office.
					- Whatever we do here, 'cost effectiveness' is the name of the game. :)
- Lighting
	 - we will not reuse existing 2x4 fixtures.
		 - [cutsheet](https://github.com/OpeningDesign/ULI-44_E_Mifflin-Suite_802/commit/8c1c49e9b9eb6095aef850356437160e85fc35ff) of 2x4 ULI perfer's.
- allocate space for a retro arcade game (approx. 30” x 30”)
- *Replace carpet with LVT (luxury vinyl plank) flooring TBD and mutually agreeable.* 
	- Flooring to be: http://www.patcraft.com/ProductSpecHS/Show/I311V/
		- tenants like a colorful floor. (swatch colors: 00630, 00950, 00480)
			- however, probably not a sea of this color throughout, more like pops of colors against a more neutral color. 
				- Neutral color to work with the color of the hallway carpet.
- *Repaint the suite.*
- *Install building standard mini-blinds on exterior windows.*
- Reuse wood trim around existing door and sidelight, but not fluted glass.  Will replace with clear glass.
- They will not have a reception area.
- Very minimal storage needs, that is 2x4 file cabinets not necessary.
- No wall TVs necessary
- Data
	- Tenant needs only one data port for the wireless router.
	- Existing data port locations will be sufficient.
